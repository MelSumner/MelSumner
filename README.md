# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“© Need to get ahold of me? Discord is probably the fastest (iykyk), or DM on [Mastadon](https://front-end.social/@a11yMel)!
- ðŸ”­ I created [ember-a11y-refocus](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-refocus) so Ember.js would have a solid accessible routing solution, and led other efforts to make [the framework more accessible by default](https://blog.emberjs.com/gaad-2022) and become the most accessible JavaScript framework.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m am the author of [Continuous Accessibility](https://continuousaccessibility.com) and like to talk/write/think about the [future of accessibility](https://noti.st/melsumner/FfqsyB/accessibility-is-reach).
- ðŸ˜Ž I created and continue to improve the [Accessibility Automation Tracker](https://a11y-automation.dev/).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I served in the U.S. Navy for six years as a [Cryptologic Technician (Interpretive)](https://www.navy.com/careers/cryptologic-technician). I am a decorated, disabled military veteran (5 medals, 2 commendations).
- ðŸ¦š Find out more about me by visiting [melanie.codes](https://melanie.codes).
