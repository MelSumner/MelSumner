# Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently focused on making the web more accessible!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript.
- 🌶 I'd like to learn how to write tests. Better tests. More tests. The right tests.
- 😎 I created the [Accessibility Automation Tracker](https://a11y-automation.dev/) and I think it has a lot of potential.
- 🧘 [The Zen Dev](https://thezen.dev) is a project that came from feedback I received after a conference talk.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I served in the U.S. Navy for six years as a [Cryptologic Technician (Interpretive)](https://www.navy.com/careers/cryptologic-technician).
