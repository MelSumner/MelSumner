# Hi there 👋

- 📩 Need to get ahold of me? Discord is probably the fastest (iykyk), or DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/a11yMel)!
- 🔭 I created [ember-a11y-refocus](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-refocus) so Ember.js would have a solid accessible routing solution, and led other efforts to make [the framework more accessible by default](https://blog.emberjs.com/gaad-2022) and become the most accessible JavaScript framework.
- 🌱 I’m currently thinking/writing/talking about [Continuous Accessibility](https://noti.st/melsumner/i9uja6/continuous-accessibility) and the [future of accessibility](https://noti.st/melsumner/FfqsyB/accessibility-is-reach).
- 😎 I created the [Accessibility Automation Tracker](https://a11y-automation.dev/).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I served in the U.S. Navy for six years as a [Cryptologic Technician (Interpretive)](https://www.navy.com/careers/cryptologic-technician).
- 🦚 Find out more about me by visiting [melanie.codes](https://melanie.codes).
