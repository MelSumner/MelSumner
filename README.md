# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ“© Need to get ahold of me? Discord is probably the fastest, followed by a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/a11yMel)!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on making the web more accessible!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently thinking/writing/talking about [Continuous Accessibility](https://noti.st/melsumner/i9uja6/continuous-accessibility) and the [future of accessibility](https://noti.st/melsumner/FfqsyB/accessibility-is-reach).
- ðŸ˜Ž I created the [Accessibility Automation Tracker](https://a11y-automation.dev/).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I served in the U.S. Navy for six years as a [Cryptologic Technician (Interpretive)](https://www.navy.com/careers/cryptologic-technician).
- ðŸ¦š Find out more about me by visiting [melanie.codes](https://melanie.codes).
